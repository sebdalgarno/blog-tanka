It works! But it can be time-consuming when you are doing it a lot. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to use my mouse less. It would be better to do this in the terminal.

      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I&amp;rsquo;m Seb Dalgarno.
This is my blog for all things R, fish movement, statistics, data visualization, and various other data/computery things.
I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the UNBC Freshwater Fish Ecology lab. We are using many years of acoustic telemetry data and Bayesian models to make inferences about White Sturgeon movement in the Columbia River. Formerly, I was a computational biologist at Poisson Consulting.
